### Hey, my name is Felipe Salles Faller

I'm a beginner Java Developer, I have approximately one year of experience, but I consider myself prepared for the labor market.

My skills are:
- Java 8+
- Spring Framework
- JPA
- Hibernate
- SQL
- MySQL
- MongoDB

I have passion for learning and the development is that, it is infinite learning. There is always something we can learn.

Currently i'm a Detection Fraud Analist in a financial startup. But I would like to work as a developer.
